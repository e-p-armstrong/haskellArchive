# Haskell Archive

This is a collection of small Haskell projects I wrote a few summers ago while I was working through the [Haskellbook](https://haskellbook.com/). I eventually got about halfway through the book (just past the sections on testing and cabal, if I remember rightly) before schoolwork finally forced me to pause.

I've forgotten much of this, and I'm certain that if I re-learned it I could write most of it better. But I nonetheless figured that I should archive my work somewhere on GitHub. So here's this archive.
